            <h2>Exterior</h2>
            <p>The 2025 BMW M5 G90 presents a bold redesign with more muscular proportions and aggressive detailing. Its front fascia is dominated by a wider kidney grille and sharper, angular headlights with laser technology. Air intakes have grown in size, not only for aesthetics but for improved cooling of the hybrid powertrain. The side profile features pronounced wheel arches and sleek character lines, giving the M5 an athletic yet executive look. At the rear, a sculpted bumper, quad exhaust tips, and a subtle carbon-fiber spoiler emphasize its performance roots. While it’s unmistakably an M-car, the G90 looks more mature and imposing than ever.</p>

            <h2>Interior</h2>
            <p>Inside, the G90 M5 blends performance focus with luxury and tech. The cockpit is fully digital, featuring BMW’s curved display that integrates the instrument cluster and infotainment screen seamlessly. Premium materials—like Merino leather, carbon fiber, and aluminum—surround the driver, while ambient lighting and customizable driving modes add flair and function. The front seats are heavily bolstered yet comfortable for daily use. Rear passengers benefit from improved legroom and a quieter cabin thanks to acoustic glass and better insulation. Despite being a high-performance machine, the M5 doesn’t sacrifice executive comfort.</p>

            <h2>Engine</h2>
            <p>The G90 introduces a new hybrid powertrain: a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 paired with an electric motor, producing a combined output of around 717 horsepower. Power is delivered through BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system with configurable modes, including rear-wheel-drive-only for purists. Despite its impressive output, the G90 has gained weight due to the hybrid system and added tech. As a result, it’s slightly slower and less agile than the outgoing F90 M5, especially on tight corners. That said, it’s still blisteringly fast, with 0–60 mph in around 3.2 seconds and massive torque on tap at any speed.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The 2025 BMW M5 G90 is a technological powerhouse that embraces the future while staying rooted in M performance. It’s more refined, more luxurious, and more powerful—but also heavier and slightly less raw than the F90 it replaces. For those seeking a fast, high-tech executive sedan with daily usability, the G90 delivers in full. While it may divide long-time M enthusiasts, it marks a new chapter in the evolution of performance sedans. One where power meets electrification—without losing the spirit of the M badge.</p>

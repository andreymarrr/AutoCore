                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>AutoCore was founded in 2025 by longtime friends and automotive aficionados Andras Marko and Viktor Bercik. What started as casual car conversations soon evolved into a full-scale review platform. Frustrated by shallow, ad-driven car content, they set out to build a source of trustworthy reviews, written for true car lovers. Through countless test drives and long nights editing content, AutoCore was born—and continues to grow.</p>

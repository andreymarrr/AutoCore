            <h2>Exterior</h2>
            <p>The 2025 BMW Z4 embraces a timeless roadster silhouette with modern refinements. Its long hood, short rear deck, and low-slung stance create a striking profile. The redesigned kidney grille is more sculpted and aggressive, now paired with slimmer LED headlights that enhance the car’s sporty appeal. Sharp body lines and side air intakes add a sense of motion, even when stationary. The retractable soft top opens or closes in just 10 seconds, adding versatility to its open-air character. At the rear, L-shaped taillights and integrated dual exhausts complete the dynamic design. The Z4 remains one of the sleekest convertibles on the road.</p>

            <h2>Interior</h2>
            <p>Inside, the Z4’s cockpit is focused, minimalistic, and driver-centric. The cabin features premium materials, from Vernasca leather upholstery to brushed aluminum accents. The 10.25-inch digital instrument display and iDrive infotainment system provide crisp visuals and intuitive controls. The low seating position and thick steering wheel enhance the feeling of connection to the road. Although compact, the Z4 offers enough legroom and headroom for daily comfort. Storage space is improved compared to older generations, and the trunk is surprisingly usable even with the top down. It’s a cabin designed for sporty driving without sacrificing luxury.</p>

            <h2>Engine</h2>
            <p>The 2025 Z4 comes with two main engine options: a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing around 255 horsepower, and a more powerful 3.0-liter inline-six in the M40i variant with 382 horsepower. Both are paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. Acceleration is brisk, with the M40i hitting 0–60 mph in about 4.1 seconds. The handling is sharp, responsive, and balanced, making the Z4 a joy to drive on winding roads.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The 2025 BMW Z4 continues to deliver the classic roadster experience with a modern twist. It combines sharp styling, powerful engine choices, and an engaging drive in a refined, well-equipped package. Whether you’re carving through mountain roads or cruising under the sun, the Z4 offers open-top freedom without compromise. It’s a fun, stylish, and surprisingly practical sports car—perfect for those who love the road and the spotlight.</p>

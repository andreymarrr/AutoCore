            <h2>Exterior</h2>
            <p>The 2025 Audi A6 C9 debuts with a refreshed, sharper design that blends sophistication and innovation. Its front grille is wider and flatter, flanked by new digital LED headlights with customizable light signatures. The body features clean lines, subtle creases, and refined chrome detailing for a premium, understated appearance. Aerodynamics have been subtly improved with sculpted side skirts and a sleek roofline that tapers gently toward the rear. At the back, dynamic OLED taillights and a more integrated diffuser give the A6 a confident, modern presence. The overall look is refined but unmistakably Audi—balanced between executive elegance and sporty intent.</p>

            <h2>Interior</h2>
            <p>Inside, the A6 C9 offers a sanctuary of comfort and advanced technology. The cabin features Audi’s signature horizontal layout with dual touchscreens and a fully digital Virtual Cockpit. Materials include premium leather, real wood veneers, brushed aluminum, and optional ambient lighting for a tailored atmosphere. The MMI system is faster and more intuitive, offering haptic feedback and natural voice commands. Passengers in both rows enjoy generous space, improved seat ergonomics, and whisper-quiet ride quality thanks to enhanced insulation. With wireless charging, advanced climate zones, and built-in Alexa integration, the A6’s interior is as intelligent as it is elegant.</p>

            <h2>Engine</h2>

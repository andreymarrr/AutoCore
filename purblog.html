            <h2>Exterior</h2>
            <p>The 2025 Ferrari Purosangue marks a bold departure for the brand, blending Ferrari’s unmistakable design DNA with SUV practicality. Its sculpted hood, aggressive air intakes, and flowing body lines create an athletic and luxurious presence. The front features sleek matrix LED headlights and an aerodynamic nose that channels airflow efficiently. From the side, the high beltline, frameless doors, and flared wheel arches emphasize power and motion. At the rear, quad exhaust tips and a sweeping roofline taper into an integrated spoiler, giving the Purosangue a coupe-like finish. It’s not just an SUV—it’s a Ferrari through and through.</p>

            <h2>Interior</h2>
            <p>Inside, the Purosangue redefines what a Ferrari cabin can be. A dual-cockpit layout separates the driver and front passenger with flowing symmetry and rich materials. The cabin features carbon fiber trim, fine Italian leather, Alcantara accents, and even real wood inlays. A digital instrument cluster and passenger-side display keep both sides engaged, while rear passengers enjoy independent bucket seats and exceptional legroom. There’s also a surprising amount of cargo space, made accessible with an electronic tailgate—another Ferrari first. Every detail is both functional and indulgent, crafted to deliver grand touring comfort with racing pedigree.</p>

            <h2>Engine</h2>
            <p>Under the hood, the Purosangue boasts a naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine producing 715 horsepower. Power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, enabling a 0–100 km/h time of just 3.3 seconds. The advanced all-wheel-drive system, combined with rear-wheel steering and adaptive suspension, ensures precise handling despite the higher ride height. Ferrari’s signature exhaust note remains unmistakable—deep, throaty, and pure.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The 2025 Ferrari Purosangue is more than just Ferrari’s first SUV—it’s a performance statement. With breathtaking design, uncompromising power, and surprising practicality, it delivers the brand’s legendary driving experience in a versatile, everyday format. Whether cruising mountain roads or navigating city streets, the Purosangue blends supercar dynamics with SUV usability. It’s a Ferrari built for families, but still born on the racetrack.</p>
